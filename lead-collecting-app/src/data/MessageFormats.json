    "email": "Sub: Analysis: Why [Business Name] is missing out to competitors online\n\nHi [Name/Business Name],\n\nI’ve been doing some deep-dive research on [Industry] businesses, and [Business Name] really stood out—your brand has massive potential. However, I noticed a significant gap: while your competitors are actively capturing sales online, your website link is currently leading to a placeholder page.\n\nAt Shoplift Studio, we specialize in turning placeholders into high-velocity profit engines. After engineering 200+ Shopify and WordPress ecosystems, we’ve found that business owners benefit most from:\n\n• Logic-based layouts that guide users toward the checkout without distraction.\n• A \"Hands-Off\" management system that lets you update products instantly without ever needing to touch a line of code or hire a developer for daily tasks.\n• Mobile-first engineering to capture the 80% of customers shopping from their phones.\n\nI’ve already drafted 3 specific design concepts for [Business Name] that would bridge this gap and turn your traffic into actual revenue. Would you be open to me sending those over? I’d love to show you how to take that market share back.\n\nBest regards,\nNazmul Islam\nTeam Lead | Shoplift Studio",
    "social": "Hey [Name]! 👋\n\nI’ve been researching some top-tier brands in your niche and [Business Name] really stood out. I noticed your site is still in 'placeholder mode' while your competitors are scaling. I’ve helped 200+ businesses move past this stage into full-scale online sales.\n\nI drafted a quick visual concept specifically for your brand that removes all technical friction so you can manage it yourself without a developer. Mind if I send over a 30-second preview? No pressure, just thought you’d love to see what’s possible for your storefront!"

    "email": "Sub: Moving [Business Name] beyond third-party platforms\n\nHi [Name/Business Name],\n\nI was recently researching successful brands in the [Industry] space, and [Business Name] really stood out to me. I noticed that while you have a great reputation, you don’t currently have a dedicated online storefront, or you're primarily relying on third-party marketplaces to reach your customers.\n\nHaving designed 150+ Shopify and 50+ WordPress stores, I’ve seen that businesses relying solely on third-party platforms often leave 15-30% of their profit on the table in fees, while losing the ability to truly 'own' their customer data. Without your own dedicated site, you're essentially building someone else's platform instead of your own digital asset.\n\nI specialize in helping brands transition into their own high-converting stores where you keep 100% of the profit and build a direct relationship with your buyers. I’ve actually already drafted a 'Brand-First' design concept specifically for [Business Name] that would give you total control over your sales.\n\nWould you be open to me sending that over? I’d love to show you how to move from just 'listing products' to 'owning a brand.'\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]\nE-commerce Growth Specialist | 200+ Projects",
    "social": "Hey [Name]! 👋\n\n I was checking out [Business Name] and love the products. I noticed you guys haven't launched a dedicated storefront yet and are mostly using third-party platforms. \n\nI’ve built 200+ Shopify/WP stores and I actually drafted a private 'Storefront Concept' for you that shows how much more profit you could keep by owning your own checkout. Mind if I send over a quick 30-second preview? No pressure, just thought it might be a game-changer for your growth! 🚀"

    "email": "Sub: Moving [Business Name] from a portfolio to a high-converting storefront\n\nHi [Name],\n\nI’m a huge fan of the aesthetic you’ve built at [Business Name], your work is stunning. However, I noticed you’re currently using a portfolio layout without a direct way for your audience to buy from you.\n\nMy team and I have designed 200+ websites (including 150+ Shopify stores), and we specialize in turning \"view-only\" portfolios into high-end, conversion-optimized storefronts. We provide agency-level design that preserves your unique brand style while making the checkout process seamless.\n\nBecause we are a streamlined team, we offer a very budget-friendly way to get a professional store without the high agency fees. I have a specific layout in mind that would turn your traffic into transactions. Would you be open to a brief 5-minute chat this week?\n\nBest regards,\n[Your Name]",
    "social": "Hi [Name], I just spent some time on the [Business Name] portfolio, the aesthetic is world-class. Honestly, it’s rare to see work this good.\n\nI couldn't help but notice there isn't a 'Buy' button for your audience yet. My team has built 150+ Shopify stores for creators, and I have a specific vision for how we could turn your current layout into a seamless storefront without losing that ‘boutique’ feel. \n\nI’ve already got a few ideas on how to bridge the gap between your art and direct sales while keeping the budget friendly. Would you be open to seeing a 30-second concept? \n\nBest, [Your Name]"
